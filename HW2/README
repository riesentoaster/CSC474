Signing keys without keyservers (and maybe even with) is a lot of repetitive work and the chance that somebody does something unsafe even just because of a mistake is too high I feel. I doubt that I will use GPG again for this reason but an end-to-end encrypted messenger.

I have not tried tricking people with my adversarial key because I don't want people to hate me and I don't like tricking people in general.
